    bio:"I've dedicated myself to a life of learning and technical excellence. I self-taught and worked as a location film sound recordist for ten years, working on two Oscar-winning documentaries. During that time I created my own product (a sound accessory in 6 flavors, still sold in stores), and fell in love with product design. I learned CAD and manufacturing on the job, and coded on the side, which was even more fun than CAD. I graduate from the Full Stack Web Development Immersive program at Flatiron School in June 2019. My goal is to become a technical lead.",
